% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
This report describes the development and implementation of a software-defined network (SDN). The main objective is to demonstrate how to use Mininet and the Ryu controller to efficiently manage a network, including security and monitoring functionalities.

% Background and Motivation
\section{Background and Motivation}
The rapid evolution of networking technologies has led to the development of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) as a means to enhance network flexibility and manageability. Traditional network architectures are often rigid and difficult to manage, especially in large-scale environments. SDN decouples the control plane from the data plane, enabling centralized network management and programmability.

This project aims to explore the capabilities of SDN using Mininet and the Ryu controller. The primary motivation is to implement and test key network functionalities such as load balancing, firewall, and network monitoring in a simulated environment. By integrating tools like Snort for intrusion detection and Grafana for performance metrics visualization, this project seeks to demonstrate the advantages of SDN in terms of security and efficiency.

\section{Project Description}
This project focuses on the creation and management of a software-defined network (SDN) using Mininet and the Ryu controller. The network is designed to simulate a realistic environment, implementing several key functionalities and integrating various tools to enhance performance, security, and monitoring capabilities. The primary components and tools used in this project include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SDN-based Network:} The foundation of the project is a software-defined network that allows for centralized control and dynamic configuration of network elements.
    \item \textbf{Simulation Environment: Mininet} Mininet is used to simulate the network topology, providing a platform to test and develop SDN applications in a controlled environment.
    \item \textbf{Controller: RYU} The Ryu controller is employed to manage the SDN, implementing control logic for various network functionalities such as switching, firewall rules, and load balancing.
    \item \textbf{Load Balancer:} A load balancer is implemented to distribute network traffic evenly across multiple servers, optimizing resource utilization and improving network performance.
    \item \textbf{Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Snort} Snort is integrated into the network to monitor traffic for suspicious activities and potential security threats.
    \item \textbf{Attack Generator: hping3} The hping3 tool is used to simulate different types of network attacks, allowing for testing and validation of the network's security mechanisms.
    \item \textbf{Monitoring and Visualization: Grafana} Grafana, in combination with Telegraf, is used to monitor network performance metrics and visualize data, providing insights into network health and behavior.
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Network Topology and Components}
    \label{fig:network_topology}
\end{figure}

The network topology (see Figure \ref{fig:network_topology}) is structured to simulate a typical enterprise network with the following components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hosts:} Two hosts (\texttt{203.0.113.105} and \texttt{203.0.113.100}) represent external devices connecting to the network.
    \item \textbf{Switches:} Three switches (\texttt{s1}, \texttt{s2}, \texttt{s3}) are used to manage data traffic within the network.
    \item \textbf{Router:} A router (\texttt{r0}) connects different segments of the network, facilitating communication between them.
    \item \textbf{Servers:} Two servers (\texttt{10.0.0.100} and \texttt{10.0.0.200}) are deployed to handle application workloads and are load-balanced to optimize performance.
    \item \textbf{Database Server:} A database server (\texttt{192.168.1.100}) is placed in the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) to handle sensitive data transactions securely.
    \item \textbf{Snort IDS:} Snort is configured to monitor traffic between the external hosts and the internal network, providing real-time intrusion detection.
    \item \textbf{Grafana Monitoring:} Grafana is set up to collect and visualize network performance metrics, integrating with Telegraf for data collection.
\end{itemize}

The design and implementation of this SDN project aims to demonstrate the benefits of SDN in terms of network flexibility, security, and performance monitoring. The integration of various tools and functionalities highlights the potential of SDN to manage and secure modern network infrastructures effectively.



\section{Implementation}

The implementation of the SDN project involves several scripts that configure and manage different aspects of the network. Below, we detail the functionality and configuration of each script used in this project.

\subsection{RYU Controller}

\subsubsection{snort.py}
The \texttt{snort.py} script integrates the Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with the Ryu controller. This script configures Snort to monitor network traffic for potential threats and anomalies. The integration with Ryu allows Snort to send alerts to the controller, which can then take appropriate actions, such as blocking malicious traffic.

\begin{verbatim}
from ryu.base import app_manager
from ryu.controller import ofp_event
from ryu.controller.handler import MAIN_DISPATCHER, set_ev_cls
from ryu.ofproto import ofproto_v1_3
from ryu.lib.packet import packet, ethernet, ipv4, icmp
from ryu.lib import snortlib

class SimpleSwitchSnort(app_manager.RyuApp):
    OFP_VERSIONS = [ofproto_v1_3.OFP_VERSION]
    _CONTEXTS = {'snortlib': snortlib.SnortLib}

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(SimpleSwitchSnort, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.snort = kwargs['snortlib']
        self.snort_port = 3
        self.mac_to_port = {}

        socket_config = {'unixsock': True}
        self.snort.set_config(socket_config)
        self.snort.start_socket_server()

    def packet_print(self, pkt):
        pkt = packet.Packet(array.array('B', pkt))
        eth = pkt.get_protocol(ethernet.ethernet)
        _ipv4 = pkt.get_protocol(ipv4.ipv4)
        _icmp = pkt.get_protocol(icmp.icmp)

        if eth:
            src_mac = eth.src
            dst_mac = eth.dst
            self.logger.info(f"Ethernet: src_mac={src_mac}, dst_mac={dst_mac}")

        if _ipv4:
            src_ip = _ipv4.src
            dst_ip = _ipv4.dst
            self.logger.info(f"IPv4: src_ip={src_ip}, dst_ip={dst_ip}")
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{rest\_firewall.py}
The \texttt{rest\_firewall.py} script implements a firewall using the Ryu controller. This script allows the definition and application of firewall rules through a REST API. Users can dynamically add, remove, or modify firewall rules to control network traffic and enhance security.

\begin{verbatim}
from ryu.base import app_manager
from ryu.controller import ofp_event
from ryu.controller.handler import MAIN_DISPATCHER, set_ev_cls
from ryu.lib.packet import packet, ethernet
from ryu.ofproto import ofproto_v1_3
from ryu.app.wsgi import ControllerBase, WSGIApplication, route

class SimpleFirewall(app_manager.RyuApp):
    OFP_VERSIONS = [ofproto_v1_3.OFP_VERSION]

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(SimpleFirewall, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.mac_to_port = {}

    @set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPPacketIn, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
    def _packet_in_handler(self, ev):
        msg = ev.msg
        datapath = msg.datapath
        ofproto = datapath.ofproto
        parser = datapath.ofproto_parser
        in_port = msg.match['in_port']

        pkt = packet.Packet(msg.data)
        eth = pkt.get_protocol(ethernet.ethernet)
        dst = eth.dst
        src = eth.src

        dpid = datapath.id
        self.mac_to_port.setdefault(dpid, {})

        self.mac_to_port[dpid][src] = in_port

        if dst in self.mac_to_port[dpid]:
            out_port = self.mac_to_port[dpid][dst]
        else:
            out_port = ofproto.OFPP_FLOOD

        actions = [parser.OFPActionOutput(out_port)]
        data = None
        if msg.buffer_id == ofproto.OFP_NO_BUFFER:
            data = msg.data

        out = parser.OFPPacketOut(datapath=datapath, buffer_id=msg.buffer_id,
                                  in_port=in_port, actions=actions, data=data)
        datapath.send_msg(out)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Load Balancer}

\subsubsection{load\_balancer.py}
The \texttt{load\_balancer.py} script implements load balancing functionality in the network. Our goal is to offer some service even if we get a DDoS attack. Therefore the strategy we opted is the following one. 
We will have a set of priority IPs, that will be our regular customers. These customers will get be redirected to server1. Thus, in case of attack, all the petitions from other machines will go into server2. 
It is clear that this load balancer is not intended to equally distribute the load. 

Since our topology includes different switches and a router, the example we had in the lab was not useful, since it was intended to be used with just one switch.
To solve this problem, we had to change the logic how flows are applied. Now when s3 receives a packet for the virtual IP, it will add the flow into s2 too. This way we can create the path from the hosts to the servers.
Another differnce is how ARP packets affect. On the given example the logic uses the ARP packets received to change the mac address from the destination machine. Since we have different jumps until the final destination, we are not catching those ARP packets. Therefore, the logic for deciding which server to select and when to create the flows, is decided on TCP packet received with destination VIRTUAL IP.

% Results and Analysis
\section{Results and Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Description of results obtained with load balancing.
    \item Analysis of firewall performance.
    \item Results of intrusion detection with Snort.
    \item Visualization of network metrics with Grafana.
\end{itemize}

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}
The results obtained from the implementation of the SDN project have shown significant improvements in network manageability and security. The load balancer is able to successfully grant access to services for the priority customers, even under stress from a DDoS attack.
On the other hand, the firewall with snort work perfectily in conjuntion to detect DoS attacks and proceed blocking the machines. Even if the machine is targeted as a regular customer.
Finally grafana is integrated for real time statistics about the load on the servers.

However, some limitations were encountered during the project. The scalability of the network was limited by the computational resources available, and certain advanced features of Snort were not fully utilized due to configuration complexities. Future work could focus on addressing these limitations by deploying the SDN in a more scalable environment and exploring additional security features. For example displaying blocked IPs or more metrics we would be interested in gathering.

Overall, this project has highlighted the practical benefits of SDN and provided valuable insights into its implementation and management.
